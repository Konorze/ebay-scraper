Setup

Clone or download this repository
Make sure you have python installed (check with python --version)
Install the required packages (see above)
Get your telegram bot token and chat ID (see below)
If using proxies, create a proxies.txt file in the same folder as the script Add one proxy per line in the format ip:port. Example:

1.1.1.1:8-
etc.etc.etc.etc:etc

How to get telegram bot token and chat ID
To use this script, you need a telegram bot token and a chat ID heres how to get them:

Open telegram and search for @BotFather
Start a chat with @BotFather and send /newbot
BotFather will ask for a name for your bot (e.x., "My eBay bot")
Then it will ask for a username, which must end in bot (e.gx @MyEbayBot)
If the username is available, BotFather will give you a bot token (looks like 727254:AAEcbIAC1l8M9eBzFipZ2ygcbF_P-i150)
Save this token, you need it for the token argument
Go to your new bot (find it by its username, e.x @MyEbayBot)
Send /start to your bot, then send a message like "hello"
Open a browser and go to https://api.telegram.org/bot<your_token>/getUpdates, replacing <your_token> with the token from botfather
You will see a JSON response with a chat section, and inside it, an id (e.x 2572398) this is your chat ID
Save the chat ID, you need it for the chat argument
If you don't see the chat ID, send another message to the bot and refresh the URL

Usage
Run the script from the command line with required arguments below are the options and examples
Command line arguments

--query: The search term for eBay (e.x "laptop")
--min: Minimum price for items (e.x 100)
--max: Maximum price for items (e.x 500)
--interval: Time between scans in seconds (default: 60)
--duration: How long to run in seconds (default: 0, runs forever)
--token: Your telegram bot token
--chat: Your telegram chat ID
--max_send: Max number of items to send per scan (default: 3)
--proxy: Use proxies (true or false)

Example: without proxies
To search for laptops between $100 and $500, scanning every 60 seconds, sending to telegram:
python ebay_scraper.py --query "laptop" --min 100 --max 500 --interval 60 --duration 3600 --token "your_bot_token" --chat "your_chat_id" --max_send 3 --proxy false

Example: with proxies
To use proxies, make sure proxies.txt exists with valid proxies the script will exit if no working proxies are found:
python ebay_scraper.py --query "laptop" --min 100 --max 500 --interval 60 --duration 3600 --token "your_bot_token" --chat "your_chat_id" --max_send 3 --proxy true

How It works

The script starts and shows a banner
If proxy true, it checks proxies from proxies.txt and uses only working ones
It searches eBay for your query, checking 3 pages of results, sorted by new listings
It filters items by price and ensures they are valid (title length > 10, valid URL)
New items (not seen before) are sent to your telegram chat with title, price, and link
It keeps running at the set interval, checking for new items, until stopped or duration ends

Notes

The script avoids duplicates by tracking item urls
Proxies are tested for HTTP/HTTPS and removed if they fail
If using proxies, it shuffles them to avoid bans
Listings are sorted by "newly listed" to focus on recent items
Stop the script with Ctrl+C, it will show total items found

Troubleshooting

No items found: check your query, price range, or internet connection. ebay might also block your IP if not using proxies
Proxy errors: Ensure proxies.txt has valid proxies. Test with proxy false to see if it works without proxies
telegram errors: double-check your token and chat_id. Make sure your bot is added to the chat
Package errors: Run pip install aiohttp beautifulsoup4 again
